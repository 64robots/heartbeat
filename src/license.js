In util.js the method toBinaryString(), midi_parse.js and midi_stream.js are based on Matt Westcott & Ben Fishman's code:

https://github.com/gasman/jasmid/blob/master/LICENSE


The code in midi_write.js is based on Sergi Mansilla's code:

Audio recording:

If a browser doesn't support WebMIDI, heartbeat will try to fallback to Sema's Jazz plugin:

http://jazz-soft.net/

For this fallback, a slightly adapted version of Chris Wilson's WebMIDIAPIShim is used:
